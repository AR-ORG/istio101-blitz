# Exercise 1 - Accessing a Kubernetes cluster with IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service

You must already have a [cluster created](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html#container_index). Here are the steps to access your cluster.

## Install IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service command line utilities

1. Install the IBM Cloud [command line interface](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/get_started.html#getting-started).

2.  Log in to the IBM Cloud CLI by following the prompts.
 Â   
    ```bash
    ibmcloud login
    ```

3.  Install the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service plug-in.

    ```bash
    ibmcloud plugin install container-service -r Bluemix
    ```

4. To verify that the plug-in is installed properly, run `ibmcloud plugin list`. The Container Service plug-in is displayed in the results as `container-service`.

5.  Initialize the Container Service plug-in and point the endpoint to your region. For example when prompted, enter `6` for `us-south`.
    ```bash
    $ ibmcloud cs region-set
    Choose a region:
    1. ap-north
    2. ap-south
    3. eu-central
    4. uk-south
    5. us-east
    6. us-south
    Enter a number> 6
    ```
    
6. Install the Kubernetes CLI. Go to the [Kubernetes page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-via-curl) to install the CLI and follow the steps.


## Access your cluster
Learn how to set the context to work with your cluster by using the `kubectl` CLI, access the Kubernetes dashboard, and gather basic information about your cluster.

1.  To access your IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster, you must provide context to the `kubectl` CLI. To do so, the IBM Cloud CLI provides a method to download the configuration file and certificate to make a connection with your cluster. Note that if you launch a new shell after running these steps, you will need to run the `export` command again.

    a. List the available clusters.
    
    ```bash
    ibmcloud cs clusters
    ```
    
    b. Download the configuration file and certificates for your cluster using the `cluster-config` command.
    
    ```bash
    ibmcloud cs cluster-config <your_cluster_name>
    ```
    
    c. Copy and paste the output command from the previous step to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable and configure your CLI to run `kubectl` commands against your cluster.

    > Consider placing the EXPORT command in your bash profile to avoid running these commands every time you open a new shell.

2.  Get basic information about your cluster and its worker nodes. This information can help you manage your cluster and troubleshoot issues.

    a.  View details of your cluster.
    
    ```bash
    ibmcloud cs cluster-get <your_cluster_name>
    ```

    b.  Verify the worker nodes in the cluster.   
    ```bash
    ibmcloud cs workers <your_cluster_name>
    ibmcloud cs worker-get <worker_ID>
    ```

3.  Validate access to your cluster.

    a.  View nodes in the cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl get node
    ```

    b.  View services, deployments, and pods.

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc,deploy,po --all-namespaces
    ```
    
## Clone the lab repo

From your command line, run:
   
```bash   
git clone https://github.com/DataDog/istio101

cd istio101/workshop
```

This is the working directory for the workshop. You use the example `.yaml` files that are located in the _workshop/plans_ directory in the following exercises.
